title: Happy Birthday â€” Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will be introduced to HTML tags & CSS properties. They will also edit tags and properties to make their own customised greeting card.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Intro to HTML and CSS' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-intro](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro)
+ ['Birthday Card' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-card](http://jumpto.cc/web-card)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Birthday Card' Finished -- trinket.io/html/e996dc0380](https://trinket.io/html/e996dc0380)

#Frequently Asked Questions

+ This project makes use of the javascript `prefixfree.js` library, to allow animation compatibility between browsers. If this library isn't used, then children using older browsers will instead need to declare an animation for their browser, for example:

```
animation: sky 10s infinite; 		  	//for all newer browsers
-webkit-animation: sky 10s infinite;  	// For Webkit browsers(Chrome, Safari...)
-moz-animation: sky 10s infinite;     	// For Mozilla browsers
-o-animation: sky 10s infinite;       	// For Opera browsers
-ms-animation: sky 10s infinite;		// For Microsoft browsers 
```
